# Flask-Projects
This repository contains projects I'm working on while learning the Python Flask framework. I intend to use Flask to connect the front end (GUI) with back end (message transmission between server and clients) for Giraffael, my chatting application. 

## Project: [Learn Flask for Python - Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)
My goal of this project is to learn the basics of Flask, as well as finding out what role will Flask be in Giraffael. All rights to the original contributors of the tutorial: jakerieger and kohlchelsea.

You can find the instruction of this project by navigating [the official tutorial published on Jake Rieger's Flask Introduction Github page](https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction)

This project contains the following files and folders under the Flask-Projects repository: .
